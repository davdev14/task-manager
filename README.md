# task-manager
This is a ToDo list app. The aim here was to write quality code by implementing the **S.O.L.I.D principles** and some **design patterns**
# project description
## What the app does
This is a basic ToDo app where you can; ***add tasks***, ***change their status***, and ***delete them***
## How I coded it
+ **step1:** Created a function `getTask` to get the task title from a prompt in the browser
+ **step2:** Created a class that constructs an object with the properties of my task that are; _parentId_ which is `null`, _id_ which is generated by the function `generateId`, _title_ which is what the `getTask` function returns, _status_ which is the `taskStatus` enum 
+ **step3:** Stored the task object constructed in an array
+ **step4:** Get the local storage and apply an if statement which will push the object into the array if there is no item in the local storage and if there is an item it gets the item and push a new one to the array then, the array is stored in the local storage
+ **step5:** Create the functions `showTasks`, `terminateTask` and `deleteTask`
## Difficulties encountered 
the main difficulty I encountered was making sure new tasks can be added to the array in local storage without erasing the existing tasks
# How to run the project 
go to the `index.html` file and go live using the live server extension, this will open the browser, inspect the browser and go to the console then, in the terminal of your text editor run `tsc` this will run the app. In your text editor run the functions you want with the parameters you want so as to test the app.
