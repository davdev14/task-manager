# How this code respects the SOLID principles:

1. ## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   - The `generateId()` function has a single responsibility of generating a unique id.
   - The `getTask()` function is responsible for getting the task title from the prompt.
   - The `Task` class generates the task object and is responsible for initializing task properties.

2. ## Open-Closed Principle (OCP):
   - The code does not apply this principle but however it can be applied by in the case we want to add new functionalities, we will just have to create a new function for that functionality.

3. ## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
   - The code does not involve inheritance, so the LSP is not applicable.

4. ## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
   - The `TaskObjectInterface` represents an interface for a task object, specifying its properties. It defines the structure for a task object and there are no cases of a property not being used of method in the interface that is not used by the class.

5. ## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
   - The code does not really apply the DIP principle. However, the the interface on which the class depends on can be seen as an abstraction and also, the `localStorage` can also be seen as an abstraction.

Overall, the code adheres pretty well to the SOLID principles, particularly the SRP and ISP. However, the OCP and DIP principles could be further implemented if the app needs to be push to a greater level of complexity. Due to the simple nature of this app all the principles cannot be applied to their max level.
